For a given problem its hard to tell how deep the network should be, its good to start simple by using Logistic Regression and then try a 1 layer neural network and pump up the complexity till the accuracy on validation set is appreciable.&nbsp;

#### **Getting the right dimensions&nbsp;**

One of the challenges while implementing a Neural Network is to get the dimensions of various parameters right.&nbsp;
